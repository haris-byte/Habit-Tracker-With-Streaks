# 🌟 Habit Tracker with Streaks

Many people struggle with building and maintaining habits. Whether it's due to a lack of discipline or motivation, staying consistent is hard. The **Habit Tracker with Streaks** helps users build better habits by tracking daily progress, counting streaks, and providing visual feedback on consistency.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Add custom habits with names, categories, and target days.
* 🔁 Track daily progress for each habit.
* 🔥 Streak counter for every habit.
* 🏆 View highest streaks achieved.
* 📊 Reports page to analyze habit trends and progress.
* 🎯 Set goals and stay motivated with category-wise tracking.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Add a Habit**: Enter the habit name, choose a category (e.g., Health, Study, Work), and define the number of days you aim to follow it.
2. **Daily Check-ins**: Each day, mark your habit as "done" to continue your streak.
3. **Track Streaks**: The app counts how many consecutive days you've followed the habit.
4. **View Progress**: See your longest streaks and active habits on the dashboard and reports.

## 📂 Tech Stack

* **State Management**: React Hooks
